# CSC-Thesis-Simulation
In this rep, I will post the simulation of my thesis work, called "RE-aware inter-DC migration over EON". 
The simulation is provided in 3 section. The first part is related to controller checkup at the beginning of each migration cycle.
#
An output sample of the first section is as follows:

available RE =  [16601, 23252, 11837, 21197, 13118, 22703, 14832, 12980, 22866, 20252, 20976, 7778, 11597, 21510]
amount of P dynamic in each DC =  [91.25, 100.0, 77.0625, 95.0, 97.5, 79.3125, 95.0, 92.5, 97.5, 96.25, 93.125, 96.875, 100.0, 95.0]
14000.0
workload in each DC before migration=  [14091.25, 14100.0, 14077.0625, 14095.0, 14097.5, 14079.3125, 14095.0, 14092.5, 14097.5, 14096.25, 14093.125, 14096.875, 14100.0, 14095.0]
DC with insufficient RE =  [2, 4, 7, 11, 12]
